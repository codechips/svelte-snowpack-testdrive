# svelte-snowpack-testdrive

This is the example code for the article I wrote on [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) v2 and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

[Snowpack with Svelte, Typescript and Tailwind CSS is a very pleasant surprise](https://codechips.me/snowpack-svelte-typescript-tailwindcss/)

## What's in the box?

The example is based on Snowpack's Svelte [CSA](https://www.snowpack.dev/#create-snowpack-app-(csa)) and includes the following.

- :heavy_check_mark: Snowpack v2 (beta)
- :heavy_check_mark: Svelte support
- :heavy_check_mark: Typescript support
- :heavy_check_mark: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS

## To run the example
